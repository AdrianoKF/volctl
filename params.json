The program is written in Python and fairly short\r\nand should not be too hard to understand. Bug reports and patches welcome!\r\n\r\nIt's not meant to be an replacement for a full-featured mixer\r\napplication. If you're looking for that check out the excellent\r\n[pavucontrol](http://freedesktop.org/software/pulseaudio/pavucontrol/).\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n\r\n* Runs on virtually every desktop environment under GNU/Linux. (Needs to support the freedesktop system tray specs)\r\n* Control main volumes as well as individual applications\r\n* Shows applications icons and names\r\n* Internally uses the PulseAudio library directly which turned out to work much better then DBUS\r\n* Double-click opens `pavucontrol`\r\n* Mouse-wheel support\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\n1. Clone this repository somewhere to your home folder.\r\n1. Run `create-venv.sh` to initialize virtual env that holds deps.\r\n1. Make `volctl.sh` auto-start with your desktop environment. This step depends on which desktop you use.\r\n\r\n## Dependencies\r\n\r\n* python2-gobject\r\n* [python-pulseaudio](https://github.com/Valodim/python-pulseaudio)\r\n",
